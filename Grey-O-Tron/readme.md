The application expects the following to be set in the application settings:
---

**StorageConnectionString**: Tablestorage connectionstring
**GreyOtron-Token**: Discord bot token

This can be done the conventional way in an azure web app for example.

Currently the bot is hosted on azure and can be added to your server using:
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=518387999537496069&scope=bot&permissions=268512320
